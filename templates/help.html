	This site was built as an experiment in using the 
	<a href="http://soundcloud.com/">SoundCloud</a> public API along with 
	<a href="http://flask.pocoo.org">Flask</a>. The source code can be found on
	<a href="https://github.com/willshowell/like_stream">GitHub</a>.
</p>

<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>
	By creating an account, you will be able follow the likes of different SoundCloud 
	users such as your friends, music curators, and favorite artists. Over time, 
	the site will monitor their likes to generate a stream of new songs you know
	you'll love. It makes it easier to follow the favorite songs of many users
	without having to manually monitor each user.
</p>
<br>
<h2>My friends all repost their favorite tracks. This seems dumb.</h2> 
<p>
	Your friends are more practical than mine.
</p>
<br>
<h2>How is a stream generated?</h2>
<p>
	SoundCloud does not provide timestamps of when songs have been liked by its 
	users. When you start following a new user, the site will check to see if that 
	user is already being tracked. If so, you're in luck: a history with timestamps
	will have already been created for them, and their likes will fit seamlessly
	into your stream. If not, no worries, that user's most recent likes will be 
	added to the top of your stream and tracking will begin. After a few days,
	your stream will accurately reflect the likes of all the users you follow.
</p>
<br>
<h2>How real-time is it?</h2>
<p>
	That depends. A background process will be collecting information on all the
	tracked users. The frequency of updates will be subject to the
	number of users to track and hosting service chosen.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Can I stalk you?</h2>
<p>
	Yeah! Check out my site and resume (hint hint) at
